Hi-C modeling and Chromosome Visualization.
<br>
How to use? --> Get ".h5" file from polychrom simulation.
<br>
You can download the example file created using polychrom (blocks_0-99.h5) and run the simulation!
<br>
It takes quite long. So keep in mind to set the xlim and ylim properly.
<br>
<br>
You can also visualize the chromosome organization using blender.
<br>
.csv (coordinates.h5 --> coordinates.csv)

<br>
Thank you!
